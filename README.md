# Physics with Python üë©‚Äçüíª üíô

In this project, we aim to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to solve about free fall!

## Getting Started
This project helps you get familiar with Jupyter Notebook and the libraries `matplotlib` and `numpy`. You'll learn how to process data and represent it graphically.

## Objectives
- Apply physics formulas in Python code.
- Implement functions to solve physics problems.
- Understand the impact of computer science in the field of physics.

## Free Fall Simulation
One of the problems we solve is the simulation of free fall. Free fall is the motion of an object under the influence of gravitational force only. This simulation helps visualize the trajectory and velocity of an object in free fall.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
